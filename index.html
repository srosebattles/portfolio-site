            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="aboutText">
            <p>I'm a quick-learning software developer who's up-to-date with cutting-edge tools used in UI/UX development. Graduate (Summa Cum Laude, Webster scholar) from St. Scholastica with a Bachelor's in biology (healthcare emphasis) and Spanish. Since then, I've been serving in education and recently left my role at Mounds View Schools to hone my coding talent at The Iron Yard. </p>
            <p>In other words, I have not only the tech skills you need and the ability to pick up whatever new ones come my way, I bring real-world experience in people-oriented industries to the table.</p>

            <p>Who wouldn't like a Telsa? This e-commerce project is a collaboration with back-end team members. A user is able to view Tesla products available, add them to a cart, change quantity (in case one needs a fleet of high-end, sustainable cars), and see what their cost would be, including a customized tax estimate based on their zip code.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://jenessawhite.github.io/best-buy-app/">The Best of the Best Buy API</a> &#10132;</h3>
